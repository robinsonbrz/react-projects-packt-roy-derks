# Creating a Single-Page Application in React
• Setting up a new React project
• Structuring a project

Project overview
In this chapter, we will create a single-page application in React that retrieves data from
an API and runs in the browser with Webpack and Babel.
Styling will be done using Bootstrap.
The application that you'll build will show information about the popular TV show Rick and Morty, along with images.
